## Notes on Proj2

Dr. Rieder showed me a set of prompts for exploring high level
design concepts. The prompts are interesting since they lead naturally
to design revisions.

This page offers those notes.

Note that NONE of the comments here will be used to grade your work.
Repeat, none, no, zero, zip, nada. So think of these as ideas blowing
by in the wind-- which you can ignore.

That said, I found them insightful. See what you think.

## Analysis Methods

I gave claude.ai access to all your posters then I asked it to sort
the projects on two axes:

- Social impact.
  1. Individual Benefit Focus (Economic/Personal Need)
  2. Service/Ethical
  3. Transformational/Philanthropic
- Blom hierarchy of lower to higher-order cognition:
  1. Remember - Recall facts and basic concepts,
  2. Understand - Explain ideas or concepts,
  3. Apply - Use information in new situations,
  4. Analyze - Draw connections among ideas, distinguish between parts,
  5. Evaluate - Justify decisions or actions based on criteria,
  6. Create - Produce new or original work, reorganize elements into new patterns.

This returned four quadrants defined by 
(a)low/high social impact and 
(b)low/high congitive complexity
(and "quadrant1" is hight on both).
There is nothing wrong with any of these four quadrants. But as
shown below,
there are standard patterns in how to jump from low to high.
