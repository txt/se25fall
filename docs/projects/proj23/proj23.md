## Project 2 & Project 3

 
### Your Task


Project 2: 

1. Create  a   project that    boasts your skills to employers
  - A professional product that confirms to  a long list of expected norms.
2. Deliver four (or more) major and impressive milestones.
3. Define a framework within which others can deliver four (or more) major and impressive milestones (in project3)
4. Make that 1,2,3 so good and innovative that others will demand to work on your project, for their project3


Project 3: 

1, Extend  another team's Project 2 code.
2. Deliver four (or more) additional  major and impressive milestones.


#### Important Notes:

- Scope:
  - We thank you for your Project1 poster and your imaginative design proposals.
  - Project2 need not be bound by your Project1 proposal. Often, you get half through Project2 then realize the real issue is not ABC by XYZ. At which point all the milestones changes. Tnis is a good thing. 
  - Project3 need not be bound by the Project2 proposal. Maybe you have some better alternate direction. Good. Go there.
    - But whatever you do, note that Project3 is partially marked by how well  it extended someone else's Project2.
- For Project2, your goal is to do enough work and paint a clear vision for the future so that someone else wants to use your code for their next project.
- Your deliverables include a **15-minute demo** with a tutor, who will assess:
  - For project2, just how  **how maajor and impressive ** is your current project
  - For project3, just how well you extended someone else's work.
- Projects 2 and 3 will be assessed in live demo sessions with the tutor/grader.
  - Inputs to those demons are defined below but two improtant deliverables will be
    - your 1 page poster
    - your 2-5 minute demo video embedded itno 


We ask students for help scheduling all these demo sessions. Our graders/tutors are students with their own exams and assignments to complete. Hence, they might suggest demo times outside normal working hours (evenings, weekends). Please do them the courtesy of considering those times. That said, if those proposed times are inconvenient, you can, should, and must ask for other times.

>  :warning:  **IMPORTANT** : Projects 2 and 3 will be assessed in
live demo sessions with the tutor/grader.   We ask for students for their help
in  scheduling all these demo sessions. Our graders/tutors are
students with their own exams and assignments to complete.   Hence,
they might  suggest demo times outside of normal working hours
(evenings, weekends).  Please do them the  courtesy of considering
those times. That said, if those proposed times are inconvenient,
**you can, should, and must ask for other times**.

## What to Submit

Submit a **single PDF file** containing:


1. **A project poster** (similar to the Project 1 poster) aimed at attracting another team to work on your code for Project 3.
   - Include an extra QR code to your discussion forum (see below)
3. **A link to your project repository**. The repository must meet the following requirements:
   - **Public repository** (not hosted at NCSU).
   - **No keys or passwords in files.**
   - **New work should be in a separate branch from the old.**
   - The repository must contain:
     - `README.md` (with badges)
     - `.gitignore`
   - **Badges must be functional** (i.e., clicking them should lead to the respective service, such as a code coverage tool showing "78% tests passing").
   - **Demonstrate parallel work**, showing merged pull requests.
   - **Each team member should add at least 30 new test cases, for a total of 100 new test cases** (or more)covering both nominal and off-nominal scenarios (expected and problematic cases).
   - A **2-5 minute demo**, embeedded in your repo's README file, that shows off your project.
4. For Project2 only: fill in this  Rubric:

### Repository Rubric


- The project repo **MUST** have a branch called `MAIN`. Groups will be assessed via their commit history (seen under "Insights") in `MAIN`.
  - Projects where all group members are not active in discussions will either lose marks, or the offending student may be expelled from the group.
- Projects where all group members are not actively making commits will lose marks, or the offending student may be expelled from the group.
  - To assess your involvement, we need to see your involvement 
  - So groups need to maintain an active discussion in some online forum.
    - e.g. GitHub issue reports will be fun.
    - e.g. Your private discord challen. 
    - Whatever forum you use, your poster (defined above) must include a QR code link that that location

Each team starts with full marks but **loses** 0.33 marks for missing items:

## Poster Requirements


Each poster must:
