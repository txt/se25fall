Only catch things you know how to handle


```python
def atom(token: str) -> Atom:
    "Numbers become numbers; every other token is a symbol."
    try: return int(token)
    except ValueError:
        try: return float(token)
        except ValueError:
            return token
```

# **Pipes and Filters: A Case Study in Information Hiding (Parnas' Principles in Action)**


## **1. Introduction: Pipes as a Radical Shift in Software Design**
When **Ken Thompson** implemented **pipes** in UNIX in **1973**, he was unknowingly **validating** David Parnas’ principles of **information hiding** and **modular decomposition**. 


- Historical note: Parmas' paper came years **after** pipes.


Instead of monolithic programs, **pipes** allowed **small, focused tools** to be combined dynamically at runtime. 


As **Doug McIlroy**, the director of Bell Labs, famously put it:


> *“We should have some ways of coupling programs like garden hose.”*  
> *“Let programmers screw in another segment when it becomes necessary to massage data in another way.”*  
> *“Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don’t clutter output with extraneous information.”*  


These quotes highlight a **modular** approach to software:  
1. **Programs should be loosely coupled** (just as Parnas advocated).  
2. **New capabilities should be added incrementally**, without modifying existing programs.  
3. **Each module (program) should hide its implementation details** while exposing a simple, uniform interface (a text stream).  


---


## **2. Pipes as an Example of Information Hiding**
David Parnas, in *“On the Criteria to Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules”*, argued that **modules should encapsulate decisions likely to change**. Pipes **directly embody** this principle:


| **Parnas' Principle**            | **How Pipes Implement It** |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Each program in a pipeline hides its internal processing from the others. |
| **Loose Coupling** | Programs interact via a **standardized interface (text streams)**, rather than direct function calls. |
| **Minimizing Ripple Effects** | A new filter can be inserted into a pipeline **without modifying** existing programs. |
| **Separation of Concerns** | Each program performs **one function well** and delegates other concerns to different programs. |


### **2.1 Traditional Approach vs. Pipes (Modular Decomposition)**
In a **pre-pipe world**, a text-processing system would be implemented as a **monolithic** program with **hardcoded dependencies** between each stage of processing.


```plaintext
INPUT → Preprocessing → Formatting → Output Handling → PRINTER
```
If **any one part needed a change**, the **entire program had to be modified**.


With **pipes**, each stage is an **independent module**:


```plaintext
INPUT | Preprocessor | Formatter | Output Handler | PRINTER
```
Now, we can **replace or reorder** any module **without affecting the others**.


---


## **3. The Historical Moment: One Night That Changed UNIX**
Ken Thompson’s **overnight implementation of pipes** in **1973** was one of the most transformative moments in software history. Doug McIlroy recalls:


> *“It was clear to everyone, practically minutes after the system came up with pipes working, that it was a wonderful thing. Nobody would ever go back and give that up if they could.”*  
> *“The next day saw an unforgettable orgy of one-liners as everybody joined in the excitement of plumbing.”*


This **instant success** proves the **power of modular design**: when software components are properly abstracted and loosely coupled, **innovation happens organically**.


---


## **4. Pipes and Filters in Action**
Pipes fundamentally changed **how we think about software**. Instead of **applications**, UNIX introduced **tools**—small programs designed to work together dynamically.


### **4.1 Example: Processing Text with UNIX Pipes**
Before pipes, a text formatting system would require a dedicated application.  
With pipes, individual **tools** can be **chained dynamically**:


```bash
nroff files | col | lp
```
- `nroff` – Formats the text (old version of LaTeX).  
- `col` – Adjusts escape sequences to create **column-based text**.  
- `lp` – Sends the output to the **line printer**.  


**Parnas’ Information Hiding Lesson:**  
- `nroff` **doesn’t need to know** where the output goes.  
- `lp` **doesn’t need to know** where the input came from.  
- Each program **hides its internal logic** behind a **stream interface**.  


### **4.2 Example: A More Complex Pipeline**
A full document preparation system using **preprocessors**:


```bash
tbl file-1 file-2 ... | eqn | nroff -ms
```
- `tbl` – Converts **table markup** into nroff-compatible commands.  
- `eqn` – Converts **equation markup** into formatted text.  
- `nroff -ms` – Formats everything into a structured document.  


Again, **each program is oblivious to the implementation details of the others**.


---


## **5. Pipes as a Design Pattern**
### **5.1 The General Pattern: Produce, Translate, Filter, Consume**
Pipes introduce a new paradigm:


```bash
find /usr/bin/ |          # Produce data
sed 's:.*/::'  |          # Translate (strip directory paths)
grep -i '^z'   |          # Filter (select only items starting with "z")
xargs -d '\n' process     # Consume (pass to final processing command)
```
Each program operates **independently**, ensuring **maximum flexibility**.


### **5.2 The Beauty of Language Agnosticism**
> *"Filters inside pipes could be written in any language, by different teams."*


---


## **6. Performance Considerations: When Abstraction Has Costs**
Although **pipes introduce modularity**, they come with **performance trade-offs**:


- **Overhead of process creation** – Each command runs as a separate **process**, which consumes resources.  
- **Streaming latency** – Data must be transferred between processes, sometimes across networks.  
- But  **modern optimizations** (e.g., UNIX process forking, buffer sharing) mitigate these issues.


Pips also implement ``my way or the high way'':


- One way process, no jumping around
- Less suited to Gui envrionments where users can jump to any function in any order.


And pipes have advatnages:


- The operating system knows it can run each aprt of the pipe as a seperate filter.
- Debugging can be easier (just explore each part of the pipe seperately).


---


## **7. The UNIX Philosophy: Abstraction as a Design Principle**
Pipes **exemplify** the UNIX philosophy:


1. **Do one thing well.**  
2. **Write programs to work together.**  
3. **Use text streams as a universal interface.**  


Parnas would **fully endorse** this approach because it maximizes:
- **Modularity** (components are independent).  
- **Flexibility** (pipelines are reconfigurable).  
- **Maintainability** (code changes don’t affect unrelated components).  


---


## **8. Conclusion: Pipes as Cool Information Hiding Mechanism**
The **Pipes and Filters** pattern is a **pure realizations of Parnas' modularity principles**
(cough, just some years earlier):


| **Parnas' Principle**            | **How Pipes Implement It** |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Filters hide internal logic from others. |
| **Loose Coupling** | Programs interact via text streams, not direct calls. |
| **Minimizing Ripple Effects** | A new program can be inserted without modifying existing ones. |
| **Separation of Concerns** | Each program does one thing and does it well. |


Pipes **show** that **abstracting system components behind simple, well-defined interfaces** is the key to **scalable, maintainable software**.


> *Pipes weren’t just a technical innovation. They were a **cultural** and **philosophical** shift toward modular, flexible, and extensible software design.*  


---


## **Lessons from Parnas’ Modular Decomposition**


## **1. Introduction**
Modeling in software engineering is fundamentally an **abstraction tool**—it structures complex systems by focusing on **essential details** while **hiding unnecessary complexity**. This aligns with David Parnas’ seminal paper, *["On the Criteria to Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules,"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/361598.361623)* which emphasizes:


- **Information Hiding** – Grouping related design decisions together while keeping implementation details private.
- **Separation of Concerns** – Ensuring that different modules handle independent aspects of the system.


Object-oriented
and other modeling techniques provide structured ways to **abstract** software components while ensuring **maintainability, flexibility, and scalability**.


---


## **2. Parnas’ Principles and Objects as an Abstraction Mechanism**
Parnas outlined **two competing approaches** to modular decomposition:


1. **Data Flow (Traditional Decomposition)**  
   - Modules are split based on sequential steps in the execution process.  
   - This often results in **high coupling** and **brittle designs**.  


 <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5aa541cc-5bce-49d0-9794-02266cba87ed_1738x1000.png">


2. **Object-Oriented (OO) Decomposition**  
   - Modules are structured based on **information hiding** and **responsibility assignment**.  
   - Leads to **loosely coupled**, **easily extendable** systems.


<img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f126ade-1690-4705-b8f8-3d8ecd928239_2209x1000.jpeg">


When applied to **modeling**, these principles shape **different types of  diagrams**, enforcing **abstraction and modularity**.


---


## **3. OO as an Abstraction Tool (Inspired by Parnas’ Principles)**  


### **3.1 Structural Abstraction (Class and Package Diagrams)**  
#### **Parnas’ Information Hiding → Encapsulation in Objects**  
- In Parnas’ view, a module should encapsulate details that are **likely to change** together.  
- **Encapsulation** is explicitly represented in **class diagrams** via:
  - **Private attributes** (hiding implementation)
  - **Public methods** (exposing controlled access)
- **Package diagrams** define modular boundaries, ensuring clear separation between components.


#### **Example: Object-Oriented Modular Decomposition ( Class Diagram)**  
```plaintext
+--------------------------------------+
|           PaymentProcessor           |
+--------------------------------------+
| - gateway: PaymentGateway            |
| - logTransaction(tx: Transaction)    |
+--------------------------------------+
| + processPayment(amount: Double)     |
+--------------------------------------+


               ⬇ (depends on)


+--------------------------------------+
|         PaymentGateway (interface)   |
+--------------------------------------+
| + charge(amount: Double)             |
+--------------------------------------+


               ⬇ (implemented by)


+--------------------------------------+
|         StripeGateway                |
+--------------------------------------+
| + charge(amount: Double)             |
+--------------------------------------+


+--------------------------------------+
|         PayPalGateway                |
+--------------------------------------+
| + charge(amount: Double)             |
+--------------------------------------+
```
**Key Takeaways:**


- **Encapsulation:** The `PaymentProcessor` does not depend on `StripeGateway` or `PayPalGateway` directly but on an **abstract interface (`PaymentGateway`)**.
- **Modular Change:** If a new gateway is added, `PaymentProcessor` remains **unchanged**.


---


### **3.2 Behavioral Abstraction (Sequence and State Diagrams)**
#### **Parnas’ “Design for Change” → Defining Clear Responsibilities & Interactions**
- **Sequence diagrams** abstract interactions between key modules, preventing **implementation-dependent** dependencies.
- **State diagrams** abstract the **internal logic** of a system, allowing modular reasoning.


#### **Example: Data Flow Decomposition (Sequence Diagram)**  
```plaintext
User       UI Layer            Backend             Database
 |                |                |                    |
 |  Clicks "Pay"  |                |                    |
 |--------------->|                |                    | 
 |                |  sendPayment() |                    |
 |                |--------------->|                    |
 |                |                | storeTransaction() |
 |                |                |------------------->|     
 |                |                |                    |
```
**Key Takeaways:**


- **Encapsulation:** The **user** does not need to know about the database; it interacts only with the UI.
- **Minimizing Ripple Effects:** The **backend** does not expose its internal implementation; it only provides a `sendPayment()` API.


---


### **3.3 Process Abstraction (Activity and State Diagrams)**
#### **Parnas’ “Minimizing Ripple Effects” → Clear Module Responsibilities**
- **Activity diagrams** abstract workflows, preventing **low-level implementation** from affecting high-level system understanding.
- **State diagrams** abstract **complex behaviors**, ensuring **localized reasoning** without exposing unnecessary details.


#### **Example: Abstracting Compiler Workflow (Activity Diagram)**  
```plaintext
+--------------------------------------+
|          Compiler Pipeline           |
+--------------------------------------+
| 1. Lexical Analysis                  |
| 2. Parsing                            |
| 3. Semantic Analysis                  |
| 4. Code Optimization                  |
| 5. Code Generation                     |
+--------------------------------------+
```
**Key Takeaways:**
- The **compiler pipeline** abstracts implementation details (e.g., tokenization rules, parsing algorithms) from the high-level stages.
- **Modification Isolation:** Changing one phase does not affect others.


---


## **4. Modeling for Change-Resistant Systems**
Parnas emphasized that **poorly designed systems suffer from ripple effects**, where a small change in one module forces modifications elsewhere. A well-structured **modeling approach** prevents this by ensuring:  


- **Encapsulation of design decisions** – Hiding implementation details within models.  
- **Clear module responsibilities** – Using diagrams to show dependencies without exposing unnecessary details.  
- **Defined interfaces for interaction** – Ensuring modules interact only through well-defined abstractions.


### **Final Takeaways**
- **Modeling is not just documentation—it enforces modularity.**
- **Good models follow Parnas’ principles by encapsulating complexity and defining clear module boundaries.**
- **Diagrams, like modular decomposition, separate stable interfaces from change-prone implementation details.**


---


## **5. Summary Table: Parnas’ Models vs. OO Abstractions**
| **Parnas’ Principle**        | **Traditional Flow-Based Design**  | **Object-Oriented (OO) Design**  | **UML Equivalent**  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| **Encapsulation**            | Global access to data        | Hiding implementation details | **Class & Package Diagrams** |
| **Separation of Concerns**    | Logic spread across modules  | Defined responsibilities per module | **Component Diagrams** |
| **Minimizing Ripple Effects** | Changes cascade through system | Isolated changes via interfaces | **Sequence Diagrams** |
| **Information Hiding**        | All functions modify shared state | Internal data hidden within modules | **State & Activity Diagrams** |


---


## 6. OO Abstractions since Parnas


### OO Class Hierachies


Smalltalk class hierarchy (somewhere in the 1980s)


- Count the "abstract classes" (mostly, the non-leaf classes)
  - i.e. classes that will never be instantiated
  - but exist to defined shared properties of the subclasses.
  - my counts is 40% "abstract"; i.e. nearly half.
    - That's a lot of abstraction!

- More on "Streams"


  - Streams are objects that support sequential access to collections and files of sequential data. Streams can be open on sequenceable collections of any kind of object, on a source of random numbers, or on files.
  - There are two separate sets of stream classes, one for streams on collections, and one for streams on files.
  - More on "Random" as a stream:
    - [FileStream atEnd](https://github.com/bonzini/smalltalk/blob/master/kernel/FileStream.st#L528-L533)
      -  produces a finite stream of characters, terminating at end of file
    - [Random atEnd](https://github.com/bonzini/smalltalk/blob/master/kernel/Random.st#L110-L115)
      -  produces an infinite stream of machine-generated pseudo-random floating-point numbers of good quality in the range 0.0 through, but not including, 1.

- Death to flowcharts! (and, by implication, pipes)


## Design Patterns


Q: So what have programmers seen before that might repeat in future systems?    
A: Patterns


  - e.g. _idioms_ : small code-level patterns 
  - e.g. _design patterns_: common collections of a few classes
  - e.g. _archtirctures_: recurring "big picture" structures seen in large systems


- The power of patterns
  - Patterns come with review heuristics
  - Which can identify problems... which can be solved ... using other patterns.
  - So patterns take us naturally to design review/ critique/ improvement


### Patterns example 1: 3-tiered architectures
  
Data : model : dialog


- Data = ? SQL
- Model = ? some object system
- Dialog = ? some gui tool

- Problem: data and dialog both need the same constraint info (e.g. 0 <= age <= 120): Where to store it?
  - A solution: Ruby on Rails, DRY: “don’t repeat yourself”
    - Database and Web-GUi generated  from a class model 
    - Simplified (amazing) last decade’s web designs
    - Each web url has actually a method on a class
  - A very popular solution (until we went much more "REST" ful)
  - Review heuristics: 
    - Not so good if you repeat information at different layers
    - Layers = communication effort up and down the layers = maybe slow
    - Buiness model NOT hard wrired into the database or dialog? Then we can't lock up a user community!
      THey could take their logic and go elsewhere!

### Patterns example 2: Composite design patterns

Patterns have review heuristics:


  - E.g. delete cascade?  in composites 
	  - If “it” gets deleted, then do you delete the sub-parts


### Patterns example 3: CRUD: low-level code idiom
	
CRUD = create, read, update, delete
	
- In  SQL:  INSERT = C, SELECT = R , UPDATE and DELETE.
- In http:  : GET = R, DELETE.= D, PUT=?, POST=? 
  - PUT : might create  new user or update info on an existing user (so PUT  = C or U?)
  - POST :  sends data to the server and leaves it up to the server to do something with it  


BTW, CRUD can leap from idiom to architecture (web-scale RESTful applications)
	
Regardless
- the main points here is
that complex systems can be abstracted 
into reasonable chunks via Patterns
- Such abstraction simplifies how we discuss even complex
systems
	
Patterns have review heuristics:


- Everything is just CRUD? what about other actions?
- Can only see CRUD for some  service? How to test it effectively? 
- Limited Scope: CRUD only covers basic data operations, not capturing complex transactions or specific business rules within an application. 
- Complexity in Large Systems:
As applications grow, the simplistic CRUD approach can become cumbersome, making it difficult to manage intricate relationships between data entities and complex update scenarios. 
- Poor Error Handling:
CRUD operations often lack built-in mechanisms for handling complex error conditions or validation, which can lead to issues in data integrity.
